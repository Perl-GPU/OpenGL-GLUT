Since FreeGLUT has been stable/frozen since 2005, and since shared libs are usable
across all Win32 OSs, I've included binary builds of FreeGLUT for Win32.

NOTE: OpenGL::GLUT will be removing the binary FreeGLUT library in the distribution
to replace it with library detection and/or installation as with Alien::FreeGLUT.
