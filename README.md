# OpenGL-GLUT 0.71_01

This project is to implement a standalone version of OpenGL::GLUT
to provide bindings to GLUT/FreeGLUT.  For optimum backwards compatibility,
this code is based on the implementation from OpenGL-0.70.  This will
allow developers to use GLUT/FreeGLUT bindings together with the new
OpenGL::Modern API support without requiring use of the original
Perl OpenGL which OpenGL::Modern is planned to update.
